      ## Optional mask. Must be the same dimensions as your video feed.
      ## The mask works by looking at the bottom center of the bounding box for the detected
      ## person in the image. If that pixel in the mask is a black pixel, it ignores it as a
      ## false positive. In my mask, the grass and driveway visible from my backdoor camera
      ## are white. The garage doors, sky, and trees (anywhere it would be impossible for a
      ## person to stand) are black.

      # Allows you to limit the framerate within frigate for cameras that do not support
      # custom framerates. A value of 1 tells frigate to look at every frame, 2 every 2nd frame,
