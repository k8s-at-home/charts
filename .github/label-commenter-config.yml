          We have noticed that the chart documentation has not been completely updated for this PR.
          Could you please make sure that the following items have been updated:
          - `version` in `Chart.yaml` has been updated per [semver](http://semver.org/)
          - `README_CHANGELOG.md.gotmpl` contains a summary of the updates for this new version
          - [Documentation strings](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs#valuesyaml-metadata) have been added to the keys in `values.yaml`.

          Afterwards you can run `./hack/gen-helm-docs.sh stable <chart>` again to update the chart's `README.md` file.

          We have noticed that the PR title does not adhere to our desired format.
          Could you please make sure that it follows the pattern `[<lowercase chart name>] <Update description>`?
          Example: `[radarr] Update image version`.

          Thanks!
