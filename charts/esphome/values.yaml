  ## esphome data Persistent Volume Storage Class
  ## If defined, storageClassName: <storageClass>
  ## If set to "-", storageClassName: "", which disables dynamic provisioning

  ##   set, choosing the default provisioner.  (gp2 on AWS, standard on
  ##   GKE, AWS & OpenStack)

  ## If you want to reuse an existing claim, you can pass the name of the PVC using
  ## the existingClaim variable
  # existingClaim: your-claim

  # This will set ${MQTT_PASSWORD} to the 'password' key from the 'mqtt' secret

## If you'd like to provide your own Kubernetes Secret object instead of passing your values
## individually, pass in the name of a created + populated Secret.
## All secrets will be mounted as environment variables, with each key/value mapping to a
## corresponding environment variable.
