## [2.0.0]

### Changed

- :warning: Updated `probes` logic to support custom probes, it is now possible to set your own custom probes by setting the `probes.[liveness|readiness|startup].custom` value to `true` and configuring them. Default is `false`.
- :warning: `addon.vpn.imagePullPolicy` is now `addon.vpn.[openvpn|wireguard].image.pullPolicy`. Default is `IfNotPresent`
- [code-server](https://github.com/cdr/code-server) is now an `addon` like `vpn`. This enables a code-server container inside the pod which allows you to modify a configuration in a volume attached to the pod. Default for `addons.codeserver.enabled` is `false`
- Added `envFrom` for more configuration with environment variables
- Added `dnsConfig` to be configurable
- Added support for 1.19+ ingress spec
- Added this [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

### Fixed

- `nameOverride` and `fullNameOverride` not in `values.yaml`
