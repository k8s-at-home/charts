# zwave2mqtt

This is a helm chart for [zwave2mqtt](https://zwave2mqtt.org/).

**This chart is not maintained by the upstream project and any issues with the chart should be raised [here](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/charts/issues/new/choose)**

## TL;DR;

```shell
$ helm repo add k8s-at-home https://k8s-at-home.com/charts/
$ helm install k8s-at-home/zwave2mqtt
```

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
helm install --name my-release k8s-at-home/zwave2mqtt
```

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** a zwave controller device must be accessible on the node where this pod runs, in order for this chart to function properly.

First, you will need to mount your zwave device into the pod, you can do so by adding the following to your values:

```yaml
additionalVolumeMounts:
  - name: usb
    mountPath: /path/to/device

additionalVolumes:
  - name: usb
    hostPath:
      path: /path/to/device
```

Second you will need to set a nodeAffinity rule, for example:

```yaml
affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: app
          operator: In
          values:
          - zwave-controller
```

... where a node with an attached zwave controller USB device is labeled with `app: zwave-controller`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```console
helm delete my-release --purge
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

Read through the charts [values.yaml](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/charts/blob/master/charts/zwave2mqtt/values.yaml)
file. It has several commented out suggested values.
Additionally you can take a look at the common library [values.yaml](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/charts/blob/master/charts/common/values.yaml) for more (advanced) configuration options.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,
```console
helm install my-release \
  --set env.TZ="America/New_York" \
    k8s-at-home/zwave2mqtt
```
Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the above parameters can be provided while installing the
chart. For example,
```console
helm install my-release k8s-at-home/zwave2mqtt --values values.yaml 
```

```yaml
image:
  tag: ...
```

---
**NOTE**

If you get
```console
Error: rendered manifests contain a resource that already exists. Unable to continue with install: existing resource conflict: ...`
```
it may be because you uninstalled the chart with `skipuninstall` enabled, you need to manually delete the pvc or use `existingClaim`.

## Upgrading an existing Release to a new major version

A major chart version change (like 4.0.1 -> 5.0.0) indicates that there is an incompatible breaking change potentially needing manual actions.

### Upgrading from 4.x.x to 5.x.x

As of 5.0.0 this chart was migrated to a centralized [common](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/charts/tree/master/charts/common) library, some values in `values.yaml` have changed.

Examples:

* `service.port` has been moved to `service.port.port`.
* `persistence.type` has been moved to `controllerType`.

Refer to the [common](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/charts/tree/master/charts/common) library for more configuration options.
