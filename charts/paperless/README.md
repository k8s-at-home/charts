# Paperless

This is a helm chart for [Paperless](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless). The documentation can be found here [here](https://paperless.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

**This chart is not maintained by the upstream project and any issues with the chart should be raised [here](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/charts/issues/new/choose)**

## TL;DR;

```shell
$ helm repo add k8s-at-home https://k8s-at-home.com/charts/
$ helm install k8s-at-home/paperless
```

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
helm install --name my-release k8s-at-home/paperless
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```console
helm delete my-release --purge
```
The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Configuration
The chart's [values.yaml](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/charts/blob/master/charts/paperless/values.yaml) file contains a set of suggested values for a minimal deployment. Further configuration options are found in the [common library](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/charts/blob/master/charts/common/values.yaml). All configuration for the Paperless application itself is through environment variables. Please refer to the links provided in chart's [values](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/charts/blob/master/charts/paperless/values.yaml) file.


Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,
```console
helm install paperless \
  --set env.TZ="America/New_York" \
    k8s-at-home/paperless
```
Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the above parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,
```console
helm install paperless k8s-at-home/paperless --values values.yaml
```

## Backup & Restore
A more elegant solution will be added, but until then your document can be exported and re-imported by running the following commands directly on the pod. [More info](https://paperless.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migrating.html).

Backup: `/usr/src/paperless/src/manage.py document_exporter /path/to/somewhere/`  
Restore: `/usr/src/paperless/src/manage.py document_importer /path/to/somewhere/`
