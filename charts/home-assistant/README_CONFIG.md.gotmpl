### Z-Wave / Zigbee

A Z-Wave and/or Zigbee controller device could be used with Home Assistant if passed through from the host to the pod. Skip this section if you are using zwave2mqtt and/or zigbee2mqtt or plan to.

First you will need to mount your Z-Wave and/or Zigbee device into the pod, you can do so by adding the following to your values:

```yaml
additionalVolumeMounts:
  - name: zwave-usb
    mountPath: /path/to/device

additionalVolumes:
  - name: zwave-usb
    hostPath:
      path: /path/to/device
```

Second you will need to set a nodeAffinity rule, for example:

```yaml
affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: app
          operator: In
          values:
          - zwave-controller
```

... where a node with an attached zwave and/or zigbee controller USB device is labeled with `app: zwave-controller`

### Websockets

If an ingress controller is being used with home assistant, web sockets must be enabled using annotations to enable support of web sockets.

Using NGINX as an example the following will need to be added to your values:

```yaml
ingress:
  enabled: true
  annotations:
    nginx.org/websocket-services: home-assistant
```

The value derived is the name of the kubernetes service object for home-assistant
