## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `dnsmadeeasy-webhook`

## Configuration

Read through the [values.yaml](./values.yaml) file. It has several commented out suggested values.
Other values may be used from the [values.yaml](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/library-charts/tree/main/charts/stable/common/values.yaml) from the [common library](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/library-charts/tree/main/charts/stable/common).

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`.

```console
helm install dnsmadeeasy-webhook \
  --set env.TZ="America/New York" \
    k8s-at-home/dnsmadeeasy-webhook
```

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the above parameters can be provided while installing the chart.

```console
helm install dnsmadeeasy-webhook k8s-at-home/dnsmadeeasy-webhook -f values.yaml
```

## Values

**Important**: When deploying an application Helm chart you can add more values from our common library chart [here](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/library-charts/tree/main/charts/stable/common)

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| certManager.namespace | string | `"cert-manager"` | Namespace where the cert-manager operator was installed to |
| certManager.serviceAccountName | string | `"cert-manager"` | Service account used by the cert-manager |
| groupName | string | `"acme.mycompany.com"` | The GroupName here is used to identify your company or business unit that created this webhook. This name will need to be referenced in each Issuer's `webhook` stanza to inform cert-manager of where to send ChallengePayload resources in order to solve the DNS01 challenge. This group name should be **unique**, hence using your own company's domain here is recommended. |
| image.pullPolicy | string | `"IfNotPresent"` | Image pull policy |
| image.repository | string | `"ghcr.io/k8s-at-home/dnsmadeeasy-webhook"` | Image repository |
| image.tag | string | `"v1.0.0"` | Image tag |
| serviceAccount.create | bool | `true` | Create service account |
