**This chart is not maintained by the upstream project and any issues with the chart should be raised [here](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/charts/issues/new/choose)**

## Source Code

* <https://github.com/nutechsoftware/ser2sock>
* <https://github.com/tenstartups/ser2sock>

## Requirements

Kubernetes: `>=1.16.0-0`

## Dependencies

| Repository | Name | Version |
|------------|------|---------|
| https://library-charts.k8s-at-home.com | common | 2.2.0 |

## TL;DR

```console
helm repo add k8s-at-home https://k8s-at-home.com/charts/
helm repo update
helm install ser2sock k8s-at-home/ser2sock
```

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `ser2sock`

```console
helm install ser2sock k8s-at-home/ser2sock
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall the `ser2sock` deployment

```console
helm uninstall ser2sock
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart **including persistent volumes** and deletes the release.

## Configuration

Read through the [values.yaml](./values.yaml) file. It has several commented out suggested values.
Other values may be used from the [values.yaml](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/library-charts/tree/main/charts/stable/common/values.yaml) from the [common library](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/library-charts/tree/main/charts/stable/common).

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`.

```console
helm install ser2sock \
  --set env.TZ="America/New York" \
    k8s-at-home/ser2sock
```

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the above parameters can be provided while installing the chart.

```console
helm install ser2sock k8s-at-home/ser2sock -f values.yaml
```

## Custom configuration

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** a ser2sock controller device must be accessible on the node where this pod runs, in order for this chart to function properly.

First, you will need to mount your ser2sock device into the pod, you can do so by adding the following to your values:

```yaml
additionalVolumeMounts:
  - name: usb
    mountPath: /path/to/device

additionalVolumes:
  - name: usb
    hostPath:
      path: /path/to/device
```

Second you will need to set a nodeAffinity rule, for example:

```yaml
affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: app
          operator: In
          values:
          - ser2sock-controller
```

... where a node with an attached ser2sock controller USB device is labeled with `app: ser2sock-controller`

## Values

**Important**: When deploying an application Helm chart you can add more values from our common library chart [here](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/library-charts/tree/main/charts/stable/common)

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| additionalVolumeMounts | list | `[]` |  |
| additionalVolumes | list | `[]` |  |
| env.BAUD_RATE | int | `115200` |  |
| env.LISTENER_PORT | int | `10000` |  |
| env.SERIAL_DEVICE | string | `"/dev/ttyUSB0"` |  |
| image.pullPolicy | string | `"IfNotPresent"` |  |
| image.repository | string | `"tenstartups/ser2sock"` |  |
| image.tag | string | `"latest"` |  |
| ingress.enabled | bool | `false` |  |
| service.port.port | int | `10000` |  |
| strategy.type | string | `"Recreate"` |  |
