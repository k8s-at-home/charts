## TL;DR

```

## Installing the Chart

## Configuration

Read through the [values.yaml](./values.yaml) file. It has several commented out suggested values.
Other values may be used from the [values.yaml](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/library-charts/tree/main/charts/stable/common/values.yaml) from the [common library](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/library-charts/tree/main/charts/stable/common).

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`.

```console
helm install uptime-kuma \
  --set env.TZ="America/New York" \
    k8s-at-home/uptime-kuma
```

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the above parameters can be provided while installing the chart.

```console
helm install uptime-kuma k8s-at-home/uptime-kuma -f values.yaml
```
