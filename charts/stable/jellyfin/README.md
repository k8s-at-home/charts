## TL;DR

```console
helm repo add k8s-at-home https://k8s-at-home.com/charts/
helm repo update
helm install jellyfin k8s-at-home/jellyfin
```

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `jellyfin`

```console
helm install jellyfin k8s-at-home/jellyfin
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall the `jellyfin` deployment

```console
helm uninstall jellyfin
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart **including persistent volumes** and deletes the release.

## Configuration

Read through the [values.yaml](./values.yaml) file. It has several commented out suggested values.
Other values may be used from the [values.yaml](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/library-charts/tree/main/charts/stable/common/values.yaml) from the [common library](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/library-charts/tree/main/charts/stable/common).

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`.

```console
helm install jellyfin \
  --set env.TZ="America/New York" \
    k8s-at-home/jellyfin
```

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the above parameters can be provided while installing the chart.

```console
helm install jellyfin k8s-at-home/jellyfin -f values.yaml
```

### [6.0.0]

#### Migration !breaking changes!

*It is recommended to drop old configuration and start from scratch.*

This release will change the layout of `config` and `cache` persistent volumes.
To migrate the old configuration, manual modifications to volumes are required prior the upgrade or after the upgrade.
Be aware that `cache` will only be created after the upgrade if auto provisioning is used.

Mount (depends on used CSI) both volumes `config` and `cache` and be sure that jellyfin does not access the files (or is scaled down to zero).
The volumes are assumed to be mounted on `/mnt/config` and `/mnt/cache` in the example:

```bash
cd /mnt
mv config/cache/* cache/
rm -r config/cache
mkdir config/config
mv dlna/ branding.xml encoding.xml logging.default.json migrations.xml network.xml system.xml config/
mv data data.bak
mv data.bak/* .
rm -r data.bak
sed -i "s|<CachePath>.*</CachePath>|<CachePath>/cache</CachePath>|" config/system.xml
sed -i "s|<MetadataPath>.*</MetadataPath>|<MetadataPath>/config/metadata</MetadataPath>|" config/system.xml
sed -i "s|<EncoderAppPath>.*</EncoderAppPath>|<EncoderAppPath>/usr/lib/jellyfin-ffmpeg/ffmpeg</EncoderAppPath>|" config/encoding.xml
sed -i "s|<EncoderAppPathDisplay>.*</EncoderAppPathDisplay>|<EncoderAppPathDisplay>/usr/lib/jellyfin-ffmpeg/ffmpeg</EncoderAppPathDisplay>|" config/encoding.xml
```

Drop browser cache and cookies for your jellyfin URL!
