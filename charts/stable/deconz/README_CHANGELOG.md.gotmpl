### [5.0.0]

#### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Upgraded the common library dependency to version 3.1.1. This introduces several breaking changes (`service`, `ingress` and `persistence` keys have been refactored).
  Be sure to check out the [library chart](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/library-charts/blob/common-3.1.1/charts/stable/common/) for the up-to-date values.
- Changed image tag to `2.12.01`.

### [3.0.0]

#### Migration !breaking change!

This version migrates the chart to the common dependency. If you have used prior versions that had version labels
attached to the volume template of the `StatefulSet`, you will need to remove the `StatefulSet` manually prior to update
or the update will fail until it's removed.

If you used auto provisioning on the config volume, a new volume will be created upon update. It is recommended to **backup**
the prior configuration using Phoscon App (deCONZ frontend) and restore it on a fresh installation (default password on fresh installation: `delight`).
This will preserve all devices, settings and access tokens. The configuration can also be restored by copying files over from the old volume.

#### Changed

- Initial release using common chart
