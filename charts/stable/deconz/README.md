## Requirements

Kubernetes: `>=1.16.0-0`

## Dependencies

| Repository | Name | Version |
|------------|------|---------|
| https://library-charts.k8s-at-home.com | common | 3.2.0 |

## TL;DR

```console
helm repo add k8s-at-home https://k8s-at-home.com/charts/
helm repo update
helm install deconz k8s-at-home/deconz
```

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `deconz`

```console
helm install deconz k8s-at-home/deconz
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall the `deconz` deployment

```console
helm uninstall deconz
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart **including persistent volumes** and deletes the release.

## Configuration

Read through the [values.yaml](./values.yaml) file. It has several commented out suggested values.
Other values may be used from the [values.yaml](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/library-charts/tree/main/charts/stable/common/values.yaml) from the [common library](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/library-charts/tree/main/charts/stable/common).

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`.

```console
helm install deconz \
  --set env.TZ="America/New York" \
    k8s-at-home/deconz
```

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the above parameters can be provided while installing the chart.

```console
helm install deconz k8s-at-home/deconz -f values.yaml
```

## Custom configuration

N/A

## Changelog

All notable changes to this application Helm chart will be documented in this file but does not include changes from our common library. To read those click [here](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/library-charts/tree/main/charts/stable/common#changelog).

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

### [5.1.1]

#### Fixed

- Fixed the `DECONZ_VNC_PASSWORD` example.

### [5.0.0]

#### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Upgraded the common library dependency to version 3.1.1. This introduces several breaking changes (`service`, `ingress` and `persistence` keys have been refactored).
  Be sure to check out the [library chart](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/library-charts/blob/common-3.1.1/charts/stable/common/) for the up-to-date values.
- Changed image tag to `2.12.01`.

### [3.0.0]

#### Migration !breaking change!

This version migrates the chart to the common dependency. If you have used prior versions that had version labels
attached to the volume template of the `StatefulSet`, you will need to remove the `StatefulSet` manually prior to update
or the update will fail until it's removed.

If you used auto provisioning on the config volume, a new volume will be created upon update. It is recommended to **backup**
the prior configuration using Phoscon App (deCONZ frontend) and restore it on a fresh installation (default password on fresh installation: `delight`).
This will preserve all devices, settings and access tokens. The configuration can also be restored by copying files over from the old volume.

#### Changed

- Initial release using common chart

[5.1.1]: #511
[5.0.0]: #500
[3.0.0]: #300
