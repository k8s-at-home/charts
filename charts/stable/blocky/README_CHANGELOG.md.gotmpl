### [10.0.1]

- Updated Blocky image to `ghcr.io/0xerr0r/blocky`, which is built (using GitHub Actions) by the application developer for each release.

### [10.0.0]

#### Added

- Parameters in `values.yaml` for specifying the `jobLabel`, `targetLabels`, and `podTargetLabels` fields on the Prometheus ServiceMonitor object.

#### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Updated Blocky image and AppVersion to v0.17. This version of Blocky has a few backwards-incompatible `config.yml` differences compared to v0.15. Update your `config` chart values to check the `upstream`, `queryLog`, `certFile`, and `keyFile` settings (if applicable).
