DNS proxy as ad-blocker for local network

**This chart is not maintained by the upstream project and any issues with the chart should be raised [here](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/charts/issues/new/choose)**

## Source Code

* <https://github.com/0xERR0R/blocky>

## Requirements

Kubernetes: `>=1.16.0-0`

## Dependencies

| Repository | Name | Version |
|------------|------|---------|
| https://library-charts.k8s-at-home.com | common | 2.2.0 |

## TL;DR

```console
helm repo add k8s-at-home https://k8s-at-home.com/charts/
helm repo update
helm install blocky k8s-at-home/blocky
```

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `blocky`

```console
helm install blocky k8s-at-home/blocky
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall the `blocky` deployment

```console
helm uninstall blocky
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart **including persistent volumes** and deletes the release.

## Configuration

Read through the [values.yaml](./values.yaml) file. It has several commented out suggested values.
Other values may be used from the [values.yaml](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/library-charts/tree/main/charts/stable/common/values.yaml) from the [common library](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/library-charts/tree/main/charts/stable/common).

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`.

```console
helm install blocky \
  --set env.TZ="America/New York" \
    k8s-at-home/blocky
```

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the above parameters can be provided while installing the chart.

```console
helm install blocky k8s-at-home/blocky -f values.yaml
```

## Custom configuration

N/A

## Values

**Important**: When deploying an application Helm chart you can add more values from our common library chart [here](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/library-charts/tree/main/charts/stable/common)

| config | string | `"upstream:\n  # these external DNS resolvers will be used. Blocky picks 2 random resolvers from the list for each query\n  # format for resolver: [net:]host:[port][/path]. net could be empty (default, shortcut for tcp+udp), tcp+udp, tcp, udp, tcp-tls or https (DoH). If port is empty, default port will be used (53 for udp and tcp, 853 for tcp-tls, 443 for https (Doh))\n  externalResolvers:\n    - 46.182.19.48\n    - 80.241.218.68\n    - tcp-tls:fdns1.dismail.de:853\n    - https://dns.digitale-gesellschaft.ch/dns-query\n\n# optional: custom IP address for domain name (with all sub-domains)\n# example: query \"printer.lan\" or \"my.printer.lan\" will return 192.168.178.3\ncustomDNS:\n  mapping:\n    printer.lan: 192.168.178.3\n\n# optional: definition, which DNS resolver(s) should be used for queries to the domain (with all sub-domains). Multiple resolvers must be separated by comma\n# Example: Query client.fritz.box will ask DNS server 192.168.178.1. This is necessary for local network, to resolve clients by host name\nconditional:\n  mapping:\n    fritz.box: udp:192.168.178.1\n    lan.net: udp:192.168.178.1,udp:192.168.178.2\n\n# optional: use black and white lists to block queries (for example ads, trackers, adult pages etc.)\nblocking:\n  # definition of blacklist groups.

Attention: if the same group has black and whitelists, whitelists will be used to disable particular blacklist entries.
