## Requirements

Kubernetes: `>=1.16.0-0`

## Dependencies

| Repository | Name | Version |
|------------|------|---------|
| https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami | influxdb | 1.1.9 |
| https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami | mariadb | 9.3.14 |
| https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami | postgresql | 10.4.9 |
| https://library-charts.k8s-at-home.com | common | 3.2.0 |

## TL;DR

```console
helm repo add k8s-at-home https://k8s-at-home.com/charts/
helm repo update
helm install home-assistant k8s-at-home/home-assistant
```

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `home-assistant`

```console
helm install home-assistant k8s-at-home/home-assistant
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall the `home-assistant` deployment

```console
helm uninstall home-assistant
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart **including persistent volumes** and deletes the release.

## Configuration

Read through the [values.yaml](./values.yaml) file. It has several commented out suggested values.
Other values may be used from the [values.yaml](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/library-charts/tree/main/charts/stable/common/values.yaml) from the [common library](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/library-charts/tree/main/charts/stable/common).

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`.

```console
helm install home-assistant \
  --set env.TZ="America/New York" \
    k8s-at-home/home-assistant
```

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the above parameters can be provided while installing the chart.

```console
helm install home-assistant k8s-at-home/home-assistant -f values.yaml
```

## Custom configuration

### Z-Wave / Zigbee

A Z-Wave and/or Zigbee controller device could be used with Home Assistant if passed through from the host to the pod. Skip this section if you are using zwave2mqtt and/or zigbee2mqtt or plan to.

First you will need to mount your Z-Wave and/or Zigbee device into the pod, you can do so by adding the following to your values:

```yaml
persistence:
  usb:
    enabled: true
    type: hostPath
    hostPath: /path/to/device
```

Second you will need to set a nodeAffinity rule, for example:

```yaml
affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: app
          operator: In
          values:
          - zwave-controller
```

... where a node with an attached zwave and/or zigbee controller USB device is labeled with `app: zwave-controller`

### Websockets

If an ingress controller is being used with home assistant, web sockets must be enabled using annotations to enable support of web sockets.

Using NGINX as an example the following will need to be added to your values:

```yaml
ingress:
  enabled: true
  annotations:
    nginx.org/websocket-services: home-assistant
```

The value derived is the name of the kubernetes service object for home-assistant
