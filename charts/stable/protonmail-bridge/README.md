## Source Code

* <https://github.com/shenxn/protonmail-bridge-docker>
* <https://hub.docker.com/r/shenxn/protonmail-bridge>

## Requirements

Kubernetes: `>=1.16.0-0`

## Dependencies

| Repository | Name | Version |
|------------|------|---------|
| https://library-charts.k8s-at-home.com | common | 2.2.0 |

## TL;DR

```console
helm repo add k8s-at-home https://k8s-at-home.com/charts/
helm repo update
helm install protonmail-bridge k8s-at-home/protonmail-bridge
```

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `protonmail-bridge`

```console
helm install protonmail-bridge k8s-at-home/protonmail-bridge
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall the `protonmail-bridge` deployment

```console
helm uninstall protonmail-bridge
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart **including persistent volumes** and deletes the release.

## Configuration

Read through the [values.yaml](./values.yaml) file. It has several commented out suggested values.
Other values may be used from the [values.yaml](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/library-charts/tree/main/charts/stable/common/values.yaml) from the [common library](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/library-charts/tree/main/charts/stable/common).

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`.

```console
helm install protonmail-bridge \
  --set env.TZ="America/New York" \
    k8s-at-home/protonmail-bridge
```

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the above parameters can be provided while installing the chart.

```console
helm install protonmail-bridge k8s-at-home/protonmail-bridge -f values.yaml
```

## Custom configuration

Once installed do the following to configure the application within the pod:

1. Get the name of your deployed pod `kubectl get pods`
2. Run interactively on the pod (setup only) `kubectl exec --stdin --tty protonmail-bridge-deployment-6c79fd7f84-ftwcw -- /bin/bash`
3. Once logged in, execute the init command `bash /protonmail/entrypoint.sh init`
4. You should now see the CLI for protonmail-bridge, authenticate with login
5. (optional) If you use split address mode, change mode and info are good for printing the details.
6. Copy your SMTP server info (or IMAP, your choice)
7. Delete the active pod so a new one gets created (which will properly fire up with your persisted settings)
