  #### OUTPUTS
  prometheus:
    # config.prometheus.disable -- Disable prometheus output
    disable: false
    # config.prometheus.http_listen -- This controls on which ip and port /metrics is exported when mode is "prometheus".
    # This has no effect in other modes. Must contain a colon and port.

    report_errors: false

  influxdb:
    # config.influxdb.disable -- Disable prometheus output
    disable: true
    # config.influxdb.interval --
    interval: "30s"
    # config.influxdb.url -- InfluxDB does not require auth by default, so the user/password are probably unimportant.

    user: "unifipoller"
    # config.influxdb.pass --

    verify_ssl: false

  #### Inputs
  unifi:
    # config.unifi.dynamic -- Setting this to true and providing default credentials allows you to skip
    # configuring controllers in this config file. Instead you configure them in
    # your prometheus.yml config. Prometheus then sends the controller URL to
    # unifi-poller when it performs the scrape. This is useful if you have many,
    # or changing controllers. Most people can leave this off. See wiki for more.
    dynamic: false
    # config.unifi.defaults -- The following section contains the default credentials/configuration for any
    # dynamic controller (see above section), or the primary controller if you do not
    # provide one and dynamic is disabled. In other words, you can just add your
    # controller here and delete the following section.
    defaults:
      # config.unifi.defaults.role -- Friendly name used in dashboards. Uses URL if left empty; which is fine.
      # Avoid changing this later because it will live forever in your database.
      # Multiple controllers may share a role. This allows grouping during scrapes.
      role: "main controller"
      # config.unifi.defaults.role -- Username to talk to unifi
      user: "unifipoller"
      # config.unifi.defaults.pass -- Password to talk to unifi
      pass: "unifipoller"
      # config.unifi.defaults.url -- Url to talk to unifi
      url: "https://127.0.0.1:8443"
      # config.unifi.defaults.sites -- If the controller has more than one site, specify which sites to poll here.
      # Set this to ["default"] to poll only the first site on the controller.
      # A setting of ["all"] will poll all sites; this works if you only have 1 site too.
      sites:
        - all
      # config.unifi.defaults.verify_ssl -- If your UniFi controller has a valid SSL certificate (like lets encrypt),
      # you can enable this option to validate it. Otherwise, any SSL certificate is
      # valid. If you don't know if you have a valid SSL cert, then you don't have one
      verify_ssl: false
      # config.unifi.defaults.save_ids -- Enable collection of Intrusion Detection System Data (InfluxDB only).
      # Only useful if IDS or IPS are enabled on one of the sites.
      save_ids: false
      # config.unifi.defaults.save_dpi -- Enable collection of Deep Packet Inspection data. This data breaks down traffic
      # types for each client and site, it powers a dedicated DPI dashboard.
      # Enabling this adds roughly 150 data points per client.  That's 6000 metrics for
      # 40 clients.  This adds a little bit of poller run time per interval and causes
      # more API requests to your controller(s). Don't let these "cons" sway you:
      # it's cool data. Please provide feedback on your experience with this feature.
      save_dpi: false
      # config.unifi.defaults.save_sites -- Enable collection of site data. This data powers the Network Sites dashboard.
      # It's not valuable to everyone and setting this to false will save resources.
      save_sites: true
    # config.unifi.controllers -- Repeat any controllers like default above
