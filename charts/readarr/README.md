**This chart is not maintained by the upstream project and any issues with the chart should be raised [here](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/charts/issues/new/choose)**

## Source Code

* <https://github.com/Readarr/Readarr>
* <https://readarr.com>

## Requirements

Kubernetes: `>=1.16.0-0`

## Dependencies

| Repository | Name | Version |
|------------|------|---------|
| https://k8s-at-home.com/charts/ | common | 3.0.1 |

## TL;DR

```console
helm repo add k8s-at-home https://k8s-at-home.com/charts/
helm repo update
helm install readarr k8s-at-home/readarr
```

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `readarr`

```console
helm install readarr k8s-at-home/readarr
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall the `readarr` deployment

```console
helm uninstall readarr
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart **including persistent volumes** and deletes the release.

## Configuration

Read through the [values.yaml](./values.yaml) file. It has several commented out suggested values.
Other values may be used from the [values.yaml](../common/values.yaml) from the [common library](../common).

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`.

```console
helm install readarr \
  --set env.TZ="America/New York" \
    k8s-at-home/readarr
```

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the above parameters can be provided while installing the chart.

```console
helm install readarr k8s-at-home/readarr -f values.yaml
```

## Custom configuration

**Readarr is still in early development, and this chart will install a nightly build of Readarr.
[See the project readme for more information](https://github.com/Readarr/Readarr#readarr-is-in-early-stages-of-development-alphabeta-binary-builds-are-not-yet-available-use-of-any-test-builds-isnt-recommend-and-may-have-detrimental-effects-on-your-library). Take back-up's if you decide to use this on an existing library as the project is considered unstable**
