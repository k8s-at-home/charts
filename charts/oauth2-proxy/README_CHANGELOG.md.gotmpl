### [2.0.0]

#### Changed

- support for Kubernetes v1.16.x by way of addressing the deprecation of the Deployment object apiVersion `apps/v1beta2`.  See [the v1.16 API deprecations page](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/07/18/api-deprecations-in-1-16/) for more information.

### [3.0.0]

#### Changed

- support for [EKS IAM roles for service accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html) by adding a managed service account to the chart.  This is a breaking change since the service account is enabled by default.  To disable this behaviour set `serviceAccount.enabled` to `false`
