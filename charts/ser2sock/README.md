Serial to Socket Redirector

**This chart is not maintained by the upstream project and any issues with the chart should be raised [here](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/charts/issues/new/choose)**

## Source Code

* <https://github.com/nutechsoftware/ser2sock>
* <https://github.com/tenstartups/ser2sock>

## Requirements

## Dependencies

| Repository | Name | Version |
|------------|------|---------|

## TL;DR

```console
helm repo add k8s-at-home https://k8s-at-home.com/charts/
helm repo update
helm install ser2sock k8s-at-home/ser2sock
```

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `ser2sock`

```console
helm install ser2sock k8s-at-home/ser2sock
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall the `ser2sock` deployment

```console
helm uninstall ser2sock
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart **including persistent volumes** and deletes the release.

## Configuration

Read through the [values.yaml](./values.yaml) file. It has several commented out suggested values.
Other values may be used from the [values.yaml](../common/values.yaml) from the [common library](../common).

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`.

```console
helm install ser2sock \
  --set env.TZ="America/New York" \
    k8s-at-home/ser2sock
```

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the above parameters can be provided while installing the chart.

```console
helm install ser2sock k8s-at-home/ser2sock -f values.yaml
```

## Custom configuration

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** the USB device must be accessible on the node where this pod runs, in order for this chart to function properly.

A way to achieve this can be with nodeAffinity rules, for example:

```yaml
affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: usb
          operator: In
          values:
          - alarmdecoder
```

... where a node with an attached Coral USB device is labeled with `usb: alarmdecoder`
